**Hello!**

## Project Description
This is a project I'm working on that allows multiple people (up to 4) to play on one computer.
This is a fast paced platformer/fighter where the aim is to be the last player alive.
This project features an infinitely-generating tower that the players must climb in order to escape the rising lava.
Players also have the ability to knock other players down offensively via attacks, and defensively via blocks.

## Credits
- The tileset comes from a slightly modified version of Cavernas, https://adamatomic.itch.io/cavernas.
- The player sprites come from Mucho Pixels, https://muchopixels.itch.io/character-animation-asset-pack.
